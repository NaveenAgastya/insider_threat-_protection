# 🛡️ LLM & Behavioral Data Access Audit Insider Threat Detection and _protection Risk Scoring & Investigation System


## 📌 Overview

This project is a real-time **behavioral risk detection and investigation system** that identifies suspicious user activity using a combination of:

- Machine Learning (Isolation Forest anomaly detection)
- Rule-based risk scoring engine
- Behavioral user profiling
- Real-time scoring API
- Interactive investigation dashboard

It is designed to help security teams and investigators detect, analyze, and respond to potentially fraudulent or abnormal user behavior efficiently.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🧠 Machine Learning Risk Engine (Step 1 Completed)
- Feature engineering from raw user activity logs
- Behavioral profiling per user
- Isolation Forest-based anomaly detection
- ML-based anomaly scoring
- ML score integrated into final risk scoring pipeline

---

### 📊 Rule-Based Risk Engine
- Security rules for detecting suspicious behavior
- Examples: IP mismatch, unusual login time, device changes
- Weighted scoring system
- Fully explainable logic

---

### 🔗 Hybrid Risk Scoring System
Final risk score is computed using:
- ML anomaly score
- Rule-based score
- Behavioral context signals

This ensures a balanced and more accurate risk decision system.

---

### 🌐 Backend (FastAPI)
- Real-time scoring API
- User investigation endpoints
- ML + rule engine integration
- JSON-based structured responses

---

### 🖥️ Frontend (React Dashboard)
- User investigation dashboard
- Risk score visualization
- Behavioral history timeline
- Alert and flagged user tracking

---

### 📈 Investigation System
- User-level behavioral history tracking
- Risk timeline visualization
- Explanation of risk decisions
- Investigator review support
